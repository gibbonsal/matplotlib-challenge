Observations (also in file):
    
1. If in absence of a z-factor, there appears to be a direct correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.

2. Capomulin and Ramiscane appear to be the most successful (lowest average tumor size) and are the drugs with the most prolific sample size, both across number of mice studied and length of timeframes, but they also have the lowest standard deviation in tumor size.

3. Propiva have half as many samples as Capomulin or Ramiscane, but has more of a middle standard deviation and SEM, especially compared to Ketapril or Naftisol, which have a larger sample size but larger standard deviations.
